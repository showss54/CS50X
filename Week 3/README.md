Introduction to struct

## Problem 1 - Plurality
Problem: Write the name of the election candidates in the cmd line, get int to ask how many people will be voting and ask the same number of time for the vote. Once all the votes have been collated, populate who has received the most vote. Example:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87976355/149846991-2b0c59b6-2cfb-4728-b9cf-ba71a8e88eb9.png)

## Problem 2
Problem: User to write the names of the candidates under command line. The user is then prompted to write how many voters there are and voters are to provide rank 1-3 of each candidates. One thing to note here is that most of the code is provided from the course however inside candidate strct has a field called eliminated - this is extremely important field. The voting system will look at how many candidates have been voted in each rank

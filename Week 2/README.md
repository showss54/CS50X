# Week 1 - C | Arrays, Data Types
Introduction to a very traditional syntax based program - C

## Problem 1 - Readability
Problem: Based on the Coleman-Liau index, it uses how many words, letters and sentences there are in a text to calculate the grade in U.S to understand the text:

index = (0.0588 * Letters / Words * 100) - (0.296 * Sentences / Words * 100) - 15.8

For this practice only, number of words are captured only by a space and sentences are only captured by "." , "!" and "?".

## Problem 2 - Caesar
Problem: Based on ASCII code, it's converting the plain text into ciphered text. It requires to prompt the user to enter a key of an integer which will add to the alphabet so it produces the character after that specific number. For example, 65 is A. If the key is 2, it would be 67 becoming C. One thing to note is that if it exceeds to a certain integer, it goes outside the alphabet range in ASCII chart hence we will need to be cautious of this
